# Excercise 22 - http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex22.html

# I know Zed said to write it down, which I will, I still want a digital copy.

# First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and write down every word and symbol (another name for 'character') that you have used. 
# Make sure your list of symbols is complete.

# Excercise 1

# = Comment. Also called: Pound, hash, octothrope, mesh. They can go above your code or after you code like this: print "Test" #printing test
^ = Carrot
SyntaxError = Tells us what that error might be. Usually they are cryptic, but if you google them you will find the answer most of the time.
print = displays the text you define on the screen

Math Symbols:
+ = Plus (for adding)
- = Minus (for subtracting)
/ = slash (for dividing)
* = asterisk aka star (for multiplying)
% = percent
< = less-than
> = grater-than
<= = less-than-equal
>= = greater-than-equal

floating-point numbera = numbers with a decimal e.g.: 1000.0 is a floating point number

variable = a symbolic name given to some known or unknown quantity or value. Programmers use variables to make their code read more like english.

_ = underscore character. We use this character to put an imaginary space between words in variable names.

string = Everytime you put "" aka double quotes around a piece of text you make a string. You print them, save them to files, send them to servers, etc.

multi-line string = """
this is an example of a multi-line string
"""

Format strings:
%r = print this no matter what
%s = Allows me to insert (and potentially format) a string
%d = serves as a placeholder for a signed integer decimal value.   

\n = new line
\t = tab

"I am 6'2\" tall."  # escape double-quote inside string
'I am 6\'2" tall.'  # escape single-quote inside string

raw_input() = allows the user to input characters.

pydoc = allows you to view help documents about any python function. e.g. pydoc raw_input

open = Open a file using the file() type, returns a file object.
file = Open a file.  The mode can be 'r', 'w' or 'a' for reading (default), writing or appending. 

Modules (Libraries) - e.g.: from sys import argv
os = operating system routines for Mac, NT, or Posix depending on what system we're on.
os.path = Common operations on Posix pathnames.
sys = This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
 * argv = command line arguments e.g. $ python text.py argument

close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
read -- Reads the contents of the file, you can assign the result to a variable.
readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
truncate -- Empties the file, watch out if you care about the file.
write(stuff) -- Writes stuff to the file.

def = Function definition. Allows you to create your own functions (mini scripts, tiny commands)

To 'run', 'call', or 'use' a function all mean the same thing.

'+=' = adds another value with the variable's value and assigns the new value to the variable. (Shorthand notation)

return = to set variables to be a value from a function
